## Project Overview
The project goal is to operationalize a machine learning microservice using [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

The app—`app.py`—serves out predictions (inference) about housing prices through API calls. This project could be extended to any pre-trained machine learning model, such as those for image recognition and data labeling.
